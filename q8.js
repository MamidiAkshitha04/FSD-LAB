// Question 8:
// Given the following array:
// const colors = [‘red’, ‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘yellow’]
// Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements of the array into
// individual variables.
// Use array destructuring to extract the second and fourth elements of the array into
// individual variables.

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]

let [first, second] = colors
console.log(first, second);
let [,sec,, fourth] = colors

console.log(sec,fourth)
